 * @title DharmaSmartWalletImplementationV0
 * @author 0age
 * @notice The V0 implementation for the Dharma Smart Wallet contains helper
 * functions to facilitate lending funds to CompoundV2 and for preparing Dharma
 * users for a smooth transition to a non-custodial smart wallet. It supports
 * meta-transactions, signed by a key corresponding to the public key returned
 * by the Dharma Key Registry and relayed by any transaction submitter that has
 * provided the specified gas requirement. The smart wallet instances utilizing
 * this implementation are deployed through the Dharma Smart Wallet Factory via
 * `CREATE2`, which allows for their address to be known ahead of time, and any
 * Dai or USDC that has already been sent into that address will automatically
 * be deposited into Compound upon deployment of the new smart wallet instance.
