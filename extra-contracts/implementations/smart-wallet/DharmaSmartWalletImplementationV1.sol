 * @title DharmaSmartWalletImplementationV1

 * @notice The V1 implementation for the Dharma smart wallet is a non-custodial,
 * meta-transaction-enabled wallet with helper functions to facilitate lending
 * funds using CompoundV2, and with a security backstop provided by Dharma Labs
 * prior to making withdrawals. It contains methods to support account recovery
 * and generic actions, including in an atomic batch. The smart wallet instances
 * utilizing this implementation are deployed through the Dharma Smart Wallet
 * Factory via `CREATE2`, which allows for their address to be known ahead of
 * time, and any Dai, USDC, or Ether that has already been sent into that
 * address will automatically be deposited into Compound upon deployment of the
 * new smart wallet instance.
