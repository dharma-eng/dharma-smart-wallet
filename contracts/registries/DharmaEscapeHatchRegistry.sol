/**
 * @title DharmaEscapeHatchRegistry
 * @author 0age
 * @notice The Dharma Escape Hatch Registry is an autonomous contract to store
 * opt-in "escape hatch" accounts for Dharma Smart Wallets. A designated escape
 * hatch account can bypass all controls on the smart wallet and directly access
 * funds. Furthermore, the Adharma Smart Wallet implementation will give full
 * control to the escape hatch account, rather than the user's key ring, if one
 * is currently set on the registry. Smart wallets can register an escape hatch
 * account by calling `setEscapeHatch` on the registry from a given smart wallet
 * or remove a registered escape hatch account by calling `removeEscapeHatch`.
 * Smart wallets can also be permanently disable the escape hatch mechanism by
 * calling `permanentlyDisableEscapeHatch`. The escape hatch registry will emit
 * `EscapeHatchModified` events whenever an escape hatch has been altered, and
 * `EscapeHatchDisabled` whenever a smart wallet disables the escape hatch
 * mechanism.
