 * be destructible does not necessarily mean that it IS destructible - in other
 * words, the check performed by this contract is contract is quite strict.
 * To register a contract as indestructible in the registry, provide the target
 * contract address to the `registerAsIndestructible` function - it will throw
 * if the contract is potentially destructible. Then, anyone can call the
 * `isRegisteredAsIndestructible` view function to confirm that the contract has
 * been successfully registered as an indestructible contract. You can also call
 * the `isPotentiallyDestructible` view function to perform the destructibility
 * check without actually registering the contract. Note that this registry will
 * likely still apply through the Istanbul hardfork, but future forks may
 * introduce new opcodes or other methods by which contracts can be destroyed;
 * in that case, this registry can no longer be relied on as a safeguard against
 * destructibility.
