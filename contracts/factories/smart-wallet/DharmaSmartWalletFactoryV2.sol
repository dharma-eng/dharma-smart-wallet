 * Beacon" proxies that reference a shared implementation contract specified by
 * the Dharma Upgrade Beacon contract. It prevents operations from or being
 * applied to the wrong smart wallet if another caller frontruns them by
 * passing the target deployment address as an additional argument and checking
 * for existence of a smart wallet contract at that address. It builds upon V1
 * by including functions for setting new user signing key or cancelling a
 * signed transaction upon deployment, as well as for getting an actionID prior
