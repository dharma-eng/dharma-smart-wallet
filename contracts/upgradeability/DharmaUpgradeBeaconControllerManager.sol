/**
 * @title DharmaUpgradeBeaconControllerManager
 * @author 0age
 * @notice This contract will be owned by DharmaUpgradeMultisig and will manage
 * upgrades to the global smart wallet and key ring implementation contracts via
 * dedicated control over the "upgrade beacon" controller contracts (and can
 * additionally be used to manage other upgrade beacon controllers). It contains
 * a set of timelocked functions, where the `setTimelock` function must first be
 * called, with the same arguments that the function will be supplied with.
 * Then, a given time interval must first fully transpire before the timelock
 * functions can be successfully called.
 *
 * The timelocked functions currently implemented include:
 *  upgrade(address controller, address implementation)
 *  transferControllerOwnership(address controller, address newOwner)
 *  modifyTimelockInterval(bytes4 functionSelector, uint256 newTimelockInterval)
 *  modifyTimelockExpiration(
 *    bytes4 functionSelector, uint256 newTimelockExpiration
 *  )
 *
 * This contract also allows for immediately triggering a "rollback" to a prior
 * implementation in the event that a new vulnerability is introduced. It can
 * roll back to any implementation for a given controller + upgrade beacon pair
 * unless that implementation has been explicitly "blocked" by the owner.
 *
 * It also specifies dedicated implementations for the Dharma Smart Wallet and
 * Dharma Key Ring upgrade beacons that can be triggered in an emergency or in
 * the event of an extended period of inactivity from Dharma. These contingency
 * implementations give the user the ability to withdraw any funds on their
 * smart wallet by submitting a transaction directly from the account of any of
 * their signing keys, but are otherwise kept as simple as possible. After 48
 * hours in the contingency state, the owner may bypass the standard upgrade
 * timelock and trigger upgrades to the smart wallet and key ring implementation
 * contracts. Note that triggering a rollback, or performing a standard upgrade,
 * will cause the contingency state to be exited if it is active at the time.
 *
 * This contract can transfer ownership of any upgrade beacon controller it owns
 * (subject to the timelock on `transferControllerOwnership`), in order to
 * introduce new upgrade conditions or to otherwise alter the way that upgrades
 * are carried out.
