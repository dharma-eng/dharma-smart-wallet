/**
 * @title DharmaKeyRingImplementationV1
 * @author 0age
 * @notice The Dharma Key Ring is a smart contract that implements ERC-1271 and
 * can be used in place of an externally-owned account for the user signing key
 * on the Dharma Smart Wallet to support multiple user signing keys. For this V1
 * implementation, new Dual keys (standard + admin) can be added, but cannot be
 * removed, and the action threshold is fixed at one. Upgrades are managed by an
 * upgrade beacon, similar to the one utilized by the Dharma Smart Wallet. Note
 * that this implementation only implements the minimum feature set required to
 * support multiple user signing keys on the current Dharma Smart Wallet, and
 * that it will likely be replaced with a new, more full-featured implementation
 * relatively soon. V1 differs from V0 in that it requires that an adminActionID
 * must be prefixed (according to EIP-191 0x45) and hashed in order to construct
 * a valid signature (note that the message hash given to `isValidSignature` is
 * assumed to have already been appropriately constructed to fit the caller's
 * requirements and so does not apply an additional prefix).
