/**
 * @title DharmaSmartWalletImplementationV16
 * @author 0age
 * @notice The V16 implementation for the Dharma smart wallet is a non-custodial,
 * meta-transaction-enabled wallet with helper functions to facilitate lending
 * funds through Dharma Dai and Dharma USD Coin (which in turn use CompoundV2),
 * and with an added security backstop provided by Dharma Labs prior to making
 * withdrawals. It adds support for Dharma Dai and Dharma USD Coin - they employ
 * the respective cTokens as backing tokens and mint and redeem them internally
 * as interest-bearing collateral. This implementation also contains methods to
 * support account recovery, escape hatch functionality, and generic actions,
 * including in an atomic batch. The smart wallet instances utilizing this
 * implementation are deployed through the Dharma Smart Wallet Factory via
 * `CREATE2`, which allows for their address to be known ahead of time, and any
 * Dai or USDC that has already been sent into that address will automatically
 * be deposited into the respective Dharma Token upon deployment of the new
 * smart wallet instance. V16 fixes an improperly-configured safety check on
 * advanced calls and includes the chain ID when deriving action IDs.
